This sample application demonstrates the use of the Motive API. In order to run this application, you will need to export an application profile (XML) named "UserProfile.xml" and a calibration file (CAL) named "Calibration.cal" from Motive and place it alongside the executable, markers.exe.

Application Profile (XML) Stores all of the software settings and asset definitions. This can be exported from Motive: Motive -> File tab -> Save Profile.

Calibration (CAL) file contains system calibration. After calibrating the camera system in Motive, export this file from Motive -> File tab -> Export Calibration.
